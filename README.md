This is the solution I came up with in response to the technical test issued by SmartPension. It takes in and parses a log file located in the lib folder then prints out a list of the most visited webpages ordered from the most to the least. It also prints out another list in similar fashion but instead with unique page visits.

This was programmed with the intention that any logfile provided in the same format would work so please.

It consists of two folders:
- Lib: Containing two files for the solution and the webserver.log file provided.
-Spec: Contains all the relevant folders for the test cases.
