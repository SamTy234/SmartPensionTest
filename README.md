This is the solution I came up with in response to the technical test issued by SmartPension. It takes in and parses a log file located in the lib folder then prints out a list of the most visited webpages ordered from the most to the least. It also prints out another list in similar fashion but instead with unique page visits.

This was programmed with the intention that any logfile provided in the same format would work so please.

It consists of two folders:
- Lib: Containing two files for the solution and the webserver.log file provided.
- Spec: Contains all the relevant folders for the test cases.


Could I have done better?
Yes I feel like I could have done better with the testing were I to have more experience in TDD. At the moment in terms of using it practically all of my knowledge is self-taught. I also feel like there was potential to turn the solution into an MVC framework however in turn I feel it would have overcomplicated the problem provided and thus wasn't suitable.

If you have any further questions/feedback you would provide on how I solved this problem please do let me know.
